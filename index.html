                Hello, my name is Michael Mansi a stuent at the coding bootcamp at UCSD extension. I am 28 years old. I moved to San Diego 10 years ago to pursue a career in cosmetology. I was a lisenced cosmetologist working in a salon for 7 years. In 2015 I decided to go back to school to further my education and take a new career path. I graduated with my Associates in Sociology, but while in school I took computer science classes that i really enjoyed. Instead of finishing my Bachelors Degree I decided attend a Coding Bootcamp to expand my knowledge and puruse a career in computer programming. I am very excited and happy with the decision I made and ready to work in this amazing field.
